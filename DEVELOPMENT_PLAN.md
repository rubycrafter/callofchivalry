## Technical Implementation Notes

### Architecture Principles
1. **Scene Organization**
   - Main menu â†’ Pre-adventure â†’ Adventure â†’ End
   - Each location as separate scene
   - Challenge as reusable component

2. **Data Management**
   - Resources for items/challenges
   - Singleton for game state
   - Signal-based communication

3. **Safety Considerations**
   - Input validation
   - State consistency checks
   - Error recovery mechanisms
   - No external data fetching

### File Structure
```
game/
â”œâ”€â”€ scenes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ knight/          # Knight character scenes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ locations/       # 10 location scenes

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Save corruption**: Implement validation and backups
- **Balance issues**: Extensive playtesting, adjustable difficulty
- **Performance**: Profile and optimize challenge loading

### Content Risks
- **Repetitive gameplay**: Varied challenge types, multiple solutions
- **Unclear objectives**: Tutorial system, hint mechanics
- **Frustration**: Fair difficulty curve, multiple paths to victory

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Complete adventure in 15-30 minutes
- [ ] At least 3 viable strategies
- [ ] 80% of items useful in multiple situations
- [ ] Replayability through randomization
- [ ] Stable performance on target hardware

## Next Steps
1. Set up Knight character class
2. Implement basic location system
3. Create first 3 test challenges
4. Build minimal game loop for testing

*This plan prioritizes safety, stability, and systematic development. Each phase builds on the previous, allowing for testing and iteration throughout the process.*
